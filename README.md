# Stat 156 Final Project: Paper Replication and Additional Analysis

This is my project for STAT 156, UC Berkeley's course for Causal Inference taught my Professor Peng Ding. 

The project replicated Clearing the Air? The Effects of Gasoline Content Regulation on Air Quality, a paper by Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011). All the replication and additional analysis is listed in the RMarkdown code. Additionally, I collaborated with a fellow UC Berkeley student Saumya Choudhary. I did most of the coding and helped Saumya with the write-up.
